# Build Log

## 2024-07-29
- adding the basic param dumps, already with my basic configuration, near ready to fly. No flights yet, by the way.
- added CAD (onshape) files I used to mount the FC to the baseplate. My one complaint is the flanges on the top portion came out too thin. That said, I have reefed on it a bit and I think it's sufficient. Would thicken if doing it again.

## TODO
- [] design VTX mount and probably baseplate
