My ardupilot-based Speedybee F405 Wing AtomRC Dolphin plane's software and CAD components.

# Build Log

## 2024-07-29

- adding the basic param dumps, already with my basic configuration, near ready to fly. No flights yet, by the way.
- added CAD (onshape) files I used to mount the FC to the baseplate. My one complaint is the flanges on the top portion came out too thin. That said, I have reefed on it a bit and I think it's sufficient. Would thicken if doing it again.

- reversed incorrect pitch in radio per directions
- printed "aerodynamic" fpv camera mount (Avatar HD V1), fit is ok, a little too large so bends in ~1mm total when attached
- Reattached wings, reprogrammed servos successfully
- servo autotrim on

Nearing final build.
